# CardioTrust

CardioTrust is a research tool for cardiac electrophysiological simulation and non-invasive localization of arrhythmogenic tissue, developed as part of a PhD project at Kiel University. The project is funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) through the Collaborative Research Center CRC 1261.

## Overview

CardioTrust provides a state-space-based framework for:

- Non-invasive electroanatomical mapping (EAM) using magnetic measurements
- Estimation of myocardial current density distributions
- Simulation of cardiac tissue dynamics and pathological conditions
- Analysis of healthy and arrhythmogenic tissue patterns
- Interactive 3D visualization of results

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version) (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)
- Just (command runner)

```bash
cargo install just
```

- nextest (test runner)

```bash
cargo install cargo-nextest
```

- wasm-bindgen-cli (for WASM builds)

```bash
cargo install -f wasm-bindgen-cli
```

- Nightly Rust toolchain (for formatting)

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
```

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DenominatorIsZero/cardiotrust.git
cd cardiotrust

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo nextest run --no-fail-fast # This will fail the first time
cargo run --release # Run test scenarios by hitting start, adjust the number of parallel jobs as needed
cargo nextest run --no-fail-fast # This should pass the second time
```

## Development

### Common Commands

```bash
# Run the application
just run                 # Debug build
just release             # Release build

# Testing
just test                # Run tests
just test-all            # Run all tests including ignored ones

# Code Quality
just lint                # Run clippy checks
just fmt                 # Format code (requires nightly toolchain)
just work                # Run lint, test and benchmarks

# Benchmarking
just bench               # Run epoch benchmarks
just flamegraph         # Generate flamegraph (requires cargo-flamegraph)

# WebAssembly
just wasm-build         # Build WASM target (debug)
just wasm-run           # Build and run WASM locally
just wasm-deploy        # Build and prepare WASM for deployment (release)
just d                  # Alias for wasm-deploy
