# Implementation Plan: Repository Professionalization & Documentation

Transform CardioTrust into a portfolio-quality repository with professional documentation, metadata, and development workflows.

## Tasks

### 1. README Overhaul

**Status**: [x] Completed  
**Dependencies**: None

**Implementation Steps**:

- [x] Add professional project description (research + engineering focus)
- [x] Document personal continuation and refer to original repository.
- [x] Document installation procedures (native, development)
- [x] Add feature list showcasing algorithm capabilities
- [x] Include technology stack overview and architecture
- [x] Document Claude Code collaboration process. Make it clear that the version in the CRC repository did not use claude code.

### 2. Professional Repository Infrastructure

**Status**: [ ] Pending  
**Dependencies**: Task 1 complete

**Implementation Steps**:

- [ ] Enhance `Cargo.toml` with comprehensive package metadata
