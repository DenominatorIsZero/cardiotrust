# Implementation Plan: Repository Professionalization & Documentation

Transform CardioTrust into a portfolio-quality repository with professional documentation, metadata, and development workflows.

## Tasks

### 1. README Overhaul

**Status**: [ ] Pending  
**Dependencies**: None

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] Replace basic instructions with comprehensive project overview
- [ ] Add professional project description (research + engineering focus)  
- [ ] Document installation procedures (native, WASM, development)
- [ ] Add feature list showcasing algorithm capabilities
- [ ] Include technology stack overview and architecture
- [ ] Add professional badges and attribution
- [ ] Document Claude Code collaboration process

### 2. Professional Repository Infrastructure

**Status**: [ ] Pending  
**Dependencies**: Task 1 complete

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] Enhance `Cargo.toml` with comprehensive package metadata
- [ ] Add keywords: cardiac-simulation, medical-research, kalman-filter, gpu-computing, wasm
- [ ] Create comprehensive `justfile` with dev, build, test, lint, format, security commands
- [ ] Improve `.gitignore` for Rust, IDE, OS files, research data
- [ ] Add appropriate LICENSE file with personal fork attribution

### 3. Documentation Suite

**Status**: [ ] Pending  
**Dependencies**: Task 2 complete

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] Create `docs/architecture.md` with technical system overview
- [ ] Document algorithm approach and mathematical foundations
- [ ] Explain technology choices (Bevy, nalgebra, OpenCL, etc.)
- [ ] Cover GPU acceleration strategy and WASM deployment
- [ ] Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` with development guidelines
- [ ] Document research integrity requirements and algorithm safety

### 4. Integration & Polish

**Status**: [ ] Pending  
**Dependencies**: Task 3 complete

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] Cross-reference all documentation files properly
- [ ] Add navigation aids and consistent formatting
- [ ] Document PhD thesis â†’ personal project transition
- [ ] Update project context in all files
- [ ] Verify all links and references work
- [ ] Review for professional presentation quality

## Final Validation
- [ ] Repository creates strong professional first impression
- [ ] Documentation demonstrates research expertise + engineering skills  
- [ ] All build commands work: `just dev`, `just build`, `just test`, `just wasm-deploy`
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified against current implementation
