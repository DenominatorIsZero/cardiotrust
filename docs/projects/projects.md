### 21. Types as State Architecture Refactoring

**Work Load**: 4 points
**Prerequisites**: Error Handling Standardization
**Priority**: Nice-to-have
**Expected Outcome**: Eliminate runtime Option checks and unwraps through compile-time state guarantees using phantom types

**Context**: The codebase extensively uses Option types for managing initialization state (e.g., `model: Option<Model>`, `functional_description: Option<FunctionalDescription>`), requiring runtime validation throughout algorithm chains. The typestate pattern can eliminate these runtime checks entirely through compile-time guarantees.

**Technical Scope**:

- **Typestate model design**: Transform `Model`, `Scenario`, and other core structs to use phantom types for state management
- **State transition API**: Design safe state transition methods (e.g., `UninitializedScenario::initialize() -> InitializedScenario`)
- **Algorithm chain safety**: Ensure algorithms can only be called on properly initialized states
- **GPU context management**: Apply typestate pattern to GPU/CPU initialization and resource management
- **Performance optimization**: Eliminate all runtime state validation overhead in hot paths
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintain existing serialization and configuration file formats
- **Comprehensive conversion**: Apply pattern to scenario lifecycle, model initialization, and GPU resource management

**Example Transformation**:
```rust
// Current: Runtime validation required
struct Model {
    functional_description: Option<FunctionalDescription>,
}

// Target: Compile-time state guarantees
struct Model<S: ModelState> {
    _state: PhantomData<S>,
}
struct Uninitialized;
struct Initialized { functional_description: FunctionalDescription }
type InitializedModel = Model<Initialized>;
```

**Potential Roadblocks**:

- Complex API redesign affecting all algorithm callers
- Serialization compatibility with phantom type markers
- GPU context state management complexity
- Extensive refactoring required across entire codebase
- Learning curve for phantom type patterns and compile-time state management
