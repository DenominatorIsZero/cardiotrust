## Research Software Specific Implementation Notes

### Algorithm Safety Protocols

**Before Any Algorithm Changes**:
1. Document current behavior with test scenarios
2. Capture baseline performance with `just bench`
3. Verify GPU/CPU result consistency
4. Create rollback checkpoints

**During Implementation**:
1. Test each change against multiple scenario types
2. Continuously verify GPU/CPU parity
3. Monitor performance impact at each step
4. Validate research reproducibility

**After Implementation**:
1. Compare final results against baseline documentation
2. Verify all existing research scenarios still work
3. Document any intentional algorithm behavior changes
4. Update performance baselines if improvements achieved

### GPU/CPU Implementation Coordination

**Consistency Requirements**:
- Changes to algorithm logic must be applied to both CPU and GPU versions
- Mathematical operations must produce bit-identical results where possible
- Error handling must behave consistently across implementations
- Performance characteristics should scale similarly

**Validation Approach**:
- Test identical scenarios on both GPU and CPU implementations
- Compare numerical results within floating-point precision
- Verify performance scaling characteristics
- Test fallback from GPU to CPU implementations

### Testing Strategy

**Two-Run Test Requirement**:
- Initial test run may fail due to missing generated data
- Run CardioTrust application first to generate test scenarios
- Second test run should pass if implementation is correct
- This is normal behavior for research software with generated test data

**Scenario-Based Validation**:
- Test improvements against multiple research scenarios
- Verify results match expected patterns for each scenario type
- Check that complex algorithm chains produce correct end-to-end results
- Monitor performance across different problem sizes

### Performance Monitoring

**Benchmarking Protocol**:
- Run benchmarks before making changes (baseline)
- Monitor performance impact throughout implementation
- Run final benchmarks to document improvement/impact
- Acceptable performance variance typically ±5% for optimizations

**Critical Performance Paths**:
- GPU kernel execution times
- Memory allocation patterns in algorithm loops
- File I/O performance for large scenario data
- WASM execution performance for web deployment

### Quality Gates

**Pre-Commit Checklist**:
- [ ] Code compiles without warnings: `just lint`
- [ ] All tests pass: `just test` (may require application run first)
- [ ] Benchmarks show acceptable performance: `just bench`
- [ ] GPU/CPU implementations produce consistent results
- [ ] WASM build succeeds: `just wasm-deploy`

**Research Integrity Checklist**:
- [ ] Algorithm behavior matches specifications
- [ ] Research scenarios execute with expected results
- [ ] Mathematical correctness preserved
- [ ] Performance impact documented and acceptable

### Deployment Considerations

**Build Targets**:
- Native application for research use
- WebAssembly for web demonstration
- Various platform compatibility (Linux/macOS/Windows)

**Performance Requirements**:
- Algorithm execution performance suitable for research use
- WASM performance acceptable for demonstration purposes
- Memory usage appropriate for target hardware configurations

This systematic approach ensures that improvements to CardioTrust maintain research integrity while achieving professional software quality suitable for portfolio presentation.
